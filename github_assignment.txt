For this assignment, I cloned a repository from ProPublica named Bedfellows. By using FEC data on PACs, the database was designed to
calculate a series of seven scores tha tmeasure the length and breadth of the relationships between donors and recipients. It's purpose
is to exist as a reporting tool for journalists and researchers interested in campaign finance data.

I chose this database because I found it interesting that something this intricate could be displayed so easily for viewers by using
Python. I'm still not sure of the realm of capabilites of the language and this assignment gave me a deeper glance at the possibilites.
From my interpretation of the database, I see that the Python uses "if" statements to make something occur based on the scores they
constructed from the database. I found it interesting that the bulk of the research was done computing the scores from the database and
that Python reads the assigned scores from the imported database to know how to display and classify certain results. I also found it
interesting that all the names and queries ran in the database had to be included in a separate Python file, models.py.

My main question was deciphering how exactly the Python code relates or interacts with a MySQL database. I am far more familiar with
MySQL than I am with Python. I know that the data they used for the project was probably combed over and perfected in MySQL first, but
I'm not sure how the database interacts with the coding language or how it is displayed. There is a text file in the repository containing
queries that they ran on the data. What is the relationship between MySQL and Python Library's mysqldb and how did it influence the
creation of this project?
